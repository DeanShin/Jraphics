# Jraphics

An educational 2D graphics library for Java inspired by React and the ACM graphics library.

## Running the Example

Running the Jraphics example is most easily accomplished using an IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse. You will need to set
up your IDE to use Java 19. Afterwards, you can run the main class, which is located
at [lib/src/main/java/org/deanshin/jraphics/example/Main.java](lib/src/main/java/org/deanshin/jraphics/example/Main.java).
